# Game of Life Simulation

An interactive simulation of **Conway’s Game of Life** built in **C++** with the **wxWidgets** GUI framework.  
This project focuses on algorithms, user interaction, and visualization within a custom grid interface.  

### Features
- Interactive grid where users can toggle cells alive/dead.  
- Simulates Conway’s rules (birth, survival, death).  
- Step through multiple generations dynamically.  
- Reset and clear functionality for experimentation.  
- **Customization Settings:**
  - Adjust grid size (small, medium, large).  
  - Control simulation speed (slow, normal, fast).  
  - Toggle cell colors for better visibility.  

### Tech Stack
- C++  
- wxWidgets (GUI framework)  
- Visual Studio  

### Notes
Developed as part of coursework at **Full Sail University**.
